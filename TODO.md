# v0.2.0 --> Version releases and packages
- [ ] Use branching
- [ ] What to update?
- [ ] `create-release.sh`
- [ ] Put `create-release.sh` in the templates folder, it should be pretty generic
- [ ] Add `create-release.sh` to new-py-project function


# v0.3.0 --> Update templates/README.md
- [ ] Not specific to a particular project
- [ ] Insert the name automatically
  - [ ] Maybe using regex or something
  - [ ] This is the same that `create-release.sh` should use.


# v0.4.0 --> Run Length Encoder
- [ ] It doesn't work lol
- [ ] Better way to do it I'm sure...
